**Problem Description**

Take **T** (number of test cases) as input.

For each test case, take integer **N** as input, you have to tell whether it is a **perfect number** or not.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (excluding the number itself). A positive proper divisor divides a number without leaving any remainder.


**Problem Constraints**

1 <= T <= 10

1 <= N <= 10^6


**Input Format**

The first line of the input contains a single integer **T**.

Each of the next T lines contains a single integer **N**.


**Output Format**

In a separate line, print **YES** if a given integer is perfect, else print **NO**.
